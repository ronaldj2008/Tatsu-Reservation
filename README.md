# Tatsu-Reservation
Today we built a Node/Express based web application for handling reservation requests.

Our application will be made up of two parts: 
1) A front-end set of HTML/CSS/JS pages for entering and viewing data.
2) A back-end composed of Node/Express and basic JS for storing, updating, and relaying reservation data.

Spend the time necessary to map this application out. 

The concepts we've covered in class so far:
Servers
Routing
APIs
AJAX (GET and POST Requests)
